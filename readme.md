## Lab2

Data is sourced from the [official Latvian open data portal](https://data.gov.lv/), dataset of CSDD: https://data.gov.lv/dati/lv/dataset/transportlidzeklu-registracijas. 
The original data quality is low, it needs cleanup for actual use. The data used in this Lab assignment is a subset of original data - only cars registered during 2005-2021., only regular passenger cars.
